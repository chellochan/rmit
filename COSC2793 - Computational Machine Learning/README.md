# Computational Machine Learning

This course will introduce the basic Machine Learning concepts, covering supervised and unsupervised techniques, evaluation, as well as specific approaches such as deep neural networks. You will learn how to apply such techniques to a range of problems, using open source Machine Learning toolkits, and learn how to analyse outputs from the applications. You will perform assignments that involve a variety of real world datasets from a variety of domains.

## Assg 1 - Introduction to Machine Learning
This assignment involves preparation and analysis of a dataset representing a specific machine learning challenge, along with the application of one or more techniques of a certain class of machine learning techniques (e.g., supervised technique).

## Assg 2 - Classify Images of Cancer
This assignment is an extended project of an in-depth investigation and analysis of a machine learning problem using a different machine learning challenge from Assignment 1. Students may be able to propose and negotiate their own project and machine learning challenge.
