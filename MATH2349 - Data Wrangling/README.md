# Data Wrangling

Real-world data is commonly incomplete, noisy, and inconsistent. You will be equipped with the skills needed to prepare all forms of untidy data for analysis. You will learn about the core concepts of data wrangling, namely tidy data, data integration, data cleaning, data transformation, data standardisation, data discretisation, and data reduction. You will develop and apply your data wrangling skills to complex, noisy, and inconsistent real-world data using leading open-source software R.
