# Algorithms and Analysis

The main objective of this course is for you to acquire the tools and techniques necessary to propose practical algorithmic solutions to real-world problems which still allow strong theoretical bounds on time and space usage.

## Assignment 1 - Word Completion

> Spec: `assg1/Assignment1_Dictionary.pdf`

Three types:
1. Array-Based Dictionary
2. Linked-List-Based Dictionary
3. Trie-Based Dictionary

Four Actions:
1. Construction (A)
2. Searching (S)
3. Deletion (D)
4. Auto-completion (AC)


## Usage
```bash
python3 dictionary_file_based.py <approach> <data fileName> <command fileName> <output fileName>
```

\<approach> = <array | linkedlist | trie>

e.g. python3 dictionary_test_script.py . array sampleData500.txt analyse500.in
