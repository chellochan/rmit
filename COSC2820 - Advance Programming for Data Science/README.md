# Advanced Programming for Data Science

Advanced programming concepts and techniques for the purposes of data processing (e.g., data parsing, cleansing, integration, etc.) will be taught, enabling more complex data pre-processing and getting data ready for down-stream analysis. These include, for example, the handling of data stored in different formats (e.g., CSV, JSON, XML,), the handling of bad and missing data, and the integration of data from different sources.  The course will also introduce both fundamental and the state-of-the-art advanced techniques for text pre-processing, to convert raw natural language text data to feature representations that can be directly used in downstream analysis. The course will also explore a simple web app development framework, which enables students to deploy their developed data driven applications online.
