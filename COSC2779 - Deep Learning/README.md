# Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a field of Machine Learning that focus on large scale neural networks. Deep Networks are suited for solving a variety of complex problems, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and large-scale state estimation. While Deep Networks require vast collections of training data, the networks often outperform humans. Deep Learning has increasingly become a core aspect of both major IT companies and new tech start-ups.

You will undertake a thorough study of the Deep Learning, from its foundations in perceptronâ€™s and multi-layer networks, through to present-day deep architectures including convolutional neural networks. You will critically analyse issues with deep learning, learn how to use open source toolkits (i.e. Tensorflow), and learn how to critically analyse outputs from these applications. Assessed work will involve real world datasets from a variety of domains.

## Assg 1 - Action Unit and Emotion Recognition

Introduction to working with typical deep neural network systems, such as Tensor Flow. You will individually solve a real-world data problem, to gain experience and familiarity in the typical process for training, testing, and evaluating the performance of a neural network.

## Assg 2 - Sequence Processing with Deep learning
## Stance classification in Tweets

Major project. You will undertake solving a significant problem on a real-world data set, researching, developing, and implementing their own solution to the problem, both with and without the use existing off-the-shelf solutions.
